# Investment-Script
A script that allow the users to  check if their investments grow over time or not.

1- Summarize the project and what problem it was solving? 
- This script will allow the users to check if their investments grow over certain time or not. It will also allow the user to input the daily investment amount, monthly deposti, annual interest, etc... which will allows the calculation of the balance and interest without additional monthly deposit, and the year end balance and the end earned interest. 

2- What did you do particularly well?
- I think by getting the project done, and the script to run without problems and errors, is what I think I did well here(for the most part). 

3- Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
- Maybe one of the ways to enhance my code is to write unite tests. The greater, the more of them you write. The integration tests bit of source code, or unit, is tested independently and separately during the software development process in computer programming to ensure that it performs as intended.

4-Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
- I think the piece of code that was challenging to write was the function to calculate the bank balance without the monthly deposit. 

5- What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
- Transferable skills are crucial when applying for jobs or considering career transitions since they help us get such jobs. Transferable abilities are those that we acquire throughout the course of our lives, via work-related experiences, or through social contacts. I think one particular skill that I learned from this project that I was able to get transfer the Ideas from the pseudocode that I did early to the real actual code, which I think an important skills to have for upcoming future projects.
